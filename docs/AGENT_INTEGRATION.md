# QMD as an AI-agent backend — integration progress & plan

Goal: turn qmd into a backend for a **primary AI** (Claude, etc.) that connects
via MCP/CLI. qmd's local model acts as a **support AI (AI phụ)** that does the
legwork — retrieval, synthesis, deciding where to save docs — while the primary
AI only thinks and decides.

Two engines, two DBs:
- **Docs** → qmd's own `index.sqlite` (FTS5 + sqlite-vec).
- **Code graph** → vendored `graph/` engine (codegraph), its own DB in an
  external store dir.

---

## Architecture decisions (locked)

- **codegraph is vendored under `graph/`, not merged into `src/`.** It builds
  separately (tsc + wasm copy) and is a self-contained engine.
- **Subprocess, not library import.** qmd spawns the engine's CLI by absolute
  path; whitelisted data subcommands only. Decouples runtimes/DBs/failures.
- **`codegraph` is never on PATH and has no back door.** Enforced by: not
  linking the bin + adapter whitelist (`ALLOWED_SUBCOMMANDS`) + telemetry off
  (`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `CODEGRAPH_TELEMETRY=0`). We did NOT delete its 2136-line
  CLI (too risky / breaks on upstream update).
- **AI phụ = a module inside qmd (`src/agent/`), not a separate package and not
  a monorepo.** It reuses `src/llm.ts` (the `generate` model). No code dup with
  `graph/` because the graph engine has no LLM.
- **External graph store** chosen over in-repo `.codegraph/`: we patched the
  engine to honor `CODEGRAPH_STORE` (absolute path) so the indexed repo stays
  clean and all graphs live in one place.

## Runtime constraints (important)

- **graph engine requires Node ≥22.5** (`node:sqlite`, no wasm fallback in
  v1.0.1). Default node is now set to 22 via `nvm alias default 22`
  (v22.23.1). A fresh terminal uses node 22.
- The adapter spawns the engine with a Node binary, falling back to `node` if
  qmd itself runs under Bun. Override with `QMD_GRAPH_NODE`.
- LLM needs **`QMD_LLAMA_GPU=false`** on this Mac (Metal bug
  `ggml_metal_cpy_tensor_async`); already in the user's `.zshrc`.

## DONE

### P0 — graph wrapper + registry  ✅ tested
- `src/graph-adapter.ts` — spawn engine (`runGraph` captured, `streamGraph`
  inherit, `runGraphJson`). Whitelist, telemetry off, `CODEGRAPH_STORE` env,
  `nodeExecutable()` (Bun→node fallback), `resolveGraphBin()` (walks up for
  `graph/dist/bin/codegraph.js`; override `QMD_GRAPH_BIN`).
- `src/cli/graph-cmd.ts` — `qmd graph`:
  - `add <repo> <store> --name <n>` — `init` first time / `index --force` re-index; registers in config.
  - `list`, `remove|rm <n>`.
  - passthrough: `query explore node callers callees impact files status sync`
    (require `--name`; engine gets `--path <repo>` + store env; `--json`, `-n` forwarded).
- `src/collections.ts` — `GraphConfig`, `graphs:` registry + `getGraph`,
  `listGraphs`, `addGraph`, `removeGraph`, `NamedGraph`.
- `graph/src/directory.ts` — **patch**: `codeGraphStoreOverride()` +
  `getCodeGraphDir()` honors absolute `CODEGRAPH_STORE`.
- CLI: `case "graph"` in `src/cli/qmd.ts` switch.
- Verified: add (DB lands in store, repo stays clean), list, `callers` passthrough.

### P2 — `qmd ask` combined + AI phụ  ✅ tested
- `src/agent/synthesize.ts` — `synthesizeBrief({question, docs, graphText})`
  → markdown brief `## Summary / ## Sources / ## Code`. Uses
  `getDefaultLlamaCpp().generate()`. System instructions are prepended INLINE to
  the prompt (generate() has no systemPrompt param). Deterministic fallback if
  the model errors.
- `src/cli/ask-cmd.ts` — `qmd ask "<q>" [--graph] [--graph-name <n>] [-c <coll>] [--json]`.
  Doc leg = `hybridQuery` (inside `withLLMSession`); graph leg = `runGraph("explore", …)`
  captured text. Resolves sole graph if `--graph-name` omitted.
- CLI: `case "ask"`; parse options `graph` (bool) + `graph-name` (string) added.
- Verified: docs-only and `--graph` (brief listed functions/files/lines from the call path).

---

### P3 — `qmd doc save` (AI phụ decides placement)  ✅ tested
- `src/agent/place-doc.ts` — `decidePlacement({key, content, existingFiles})` →
  `{file, mode}` via the local model (`FILE:`/`MODE:` format, parsed; kebab-slug
  fallback). `slugify()` helper.
- `src/agent/save-doc.ts` — shared core `saveDocToCollection({collectionName,
  key, content})`: enriches file list with `path — Title: first line` cues,
  decides placement, sanitizes the path against the collection root, writes
  VERBATIM (create = `# key` + body; append = `## key` + body). `SaveDocError`.
- `src/cli/doc-cmd.ts` — `qmd doc save --collection <n> --key "<k>" "<content>"`
  (content positional or `-`/empty = stdin). `--json`.
- CLI: `case "doc"` (calls `getStore()` first to configure the LLM), option `key`.
- Caveat: placement quality is bound by the small generate model — it sometimes
  creates a new file instead of appending to the obvious one. Bigger generate
  model improves it. Mechanism (verbatim write, safe path, create/append) is solid.

### P4 — MCP tools for the primary AI  ✅ tested
- `src/mcp/server.ts` registers: `ask` (combined brief), `graph_query`
  (op = explore/query/node/callers/callees/impact/files/status), `save_doc`.
- `ask` reuses `store.search()` (QMDStore) + `runGraph("explore")` + `synthesizeBrief`.
- **Key fix:** `createMcpServer` calls `setDefaultLlamaCpp(store.internal.llm)`
  so `getDefaultLlamaCpp()` (used by synthesize/place) uses the store's configured
  models — without it, synthesis fell back to "model unavailable".
- structuredContent needs `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` casts (Brief /
  SaveDocResult lack index signatures).
- Verified: tools/list shows ask/graph_query/save_doc; `tools/call ask` returns a
  real synthesized brief.

### Synthesis quality fix (ask gave generic answers)
Symptom: `ask "how do schedules work"` returned a generic platform overview.
Root cause was NOT the model — feeding it ONLY schedules.md produced a perfect
answer. The real issues: (a) the reranker put the general `user_manual.md` first
(schedules.md's best chunk was just a heading → low score), and (b) the small
model anchors on the FIRST excerpt. Fixes in `src/agent/synthesize.ts`:
- `toDocInput(r)` — feed the whole small doc / a wide window around bestChunkPos,
  not the tiny best chunk (used by both CLI ask and MCP ask).
- `orderByTopicMatch(question, docs)` — lexical title/path match boost puts the
  on-topic doc first (overrides misleading rerank order for synthesis).
- Sharper SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM: answer the specific question, ignore tangential
  platform overviews.
Lesson: garbage-in → garbage-out; fix the content fed before blaming the model.

### `ask` synthesis modes (CLI flags + MCP args)
- default — model rewrites an abstractive brief (Summary/Sources/Code).
- `--extract` — NO model: a tight verbatim window (~600 chars) around the matched
  passage per doc. `toDocInput(r, 600)`.
- `--select` — model picks the most relevant passages but quotes are VERBATIM:
  candidates are numbered, the model returns only indices, we re-emit exact source
  text (`selectBrief` in `src/agent/synthesize.ts`). Best of both.
- `--no-rerank` / `--no-expansion` — disable retrieval-side LLM (with `--extract`
  → zero LLM at all).
All wired in both `src/cli/ask-cmd.ts` and the MCP `ask` tool.

### Rerank blend fix (wrong doc ranked first) — core search
Symptom: `query/ask "how do schedules work"` ranked the general `user_manual.md`
(#1, 0.88) above `schedules.md` (#2, 0.56). Diagnosis via `--explain`: the
reranker was CORRECT (schedules 0.729 > user_manual 0.504) but the old blend
`0.75·(1/rrfRank) + 0.25·rerank` weighted RRF position so heavily that a rank-2
doc needed a >1.5 rerank lead to overtake rank-1 — mathematically impossible, so
rerank could never reorder top RRF results. Final fix (`src/store.ts`, both
`hybridQuery` and `structuredSearch`): **min-max normalize the RRF score to 0-1**
then **blend on the same scale** as the reranker's 0-1 relevance:
`score = RERANK_BLEND_RRF_WEIGHT·rrfNorm + (1−w)·rerankScore`, `w = 0.35` (leans
reranker). The old blend mixed `1/rank` (steep) with rerank (0-1) — incommensurable
scales — so RRF position dominated; normalizing compresses the rank1↔rank2 gap to
what the actual score spread justifies, letting a confident reranker win while RRF
still keeps a real voice. After: schedules.md #1 (0.70, rerank 0.73), user_manual.md
#2 (0.68, highest RRF) — correct winner, retrieval not discarded. Tunable via
`RERANK_BLEND_RRF_WEIGHT`. Affects all of query/search/ask.

## ALL PHASES DONE (P0–P4). Possible follow-ups:
- Better placement (P3) via retrieval-biased file pick or a larger generate model.
- `ask --json` already returns {question, brief, usedGraph}; could add structured
  docs/code arrays if the primary agent needs them machine-readable.
- Consider a `graph_explore`-only convenience tool if `graph_query` op enum is clunky.

## Build / test cheatsheet

```sh
# qmd (tsc → dist). NEVER `bun build --compile`.
npm run build

# graph engine (separate)
cd graph && npm install && npm run build   # needs Node ≥22.5

# run from source
QMD_LLAMA_GPU=false bun src/cli/qmd.ts ask "…" --graph --graph-name <n>

# env for graph when qmd runs under Bun / non-22 node:
export QMD_GRAPH_BIN="$PWD/graph/dist/bin/codegraph.js"
export QMD_GRAPH_NODE="$(nvm which 22)"
```

Config file: `~/.config/qmd/index.yml` (collections, models, `graphs:`).
Expansion model was changed to `hf:Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf`;
its prompt lives in `src/llm.ts` `expandQuery()` (now has a system prompt + grammar).
